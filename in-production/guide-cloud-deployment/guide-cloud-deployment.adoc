.Goals
[abstract]
This guide highlights the different options for setting up Neo4j in the cloud.
It includes setting up Neo4j on EC2 on AWS, using our Docker image, and introduces the different Neo4j cloud-hosting partners.

.Prerequisites
[abstract]
You should know how to run and operate Neo4j locally.
Knowledge of link:/developer/language-guides[remote drivers] to access Neo4j from your application helps you connect to your cloud-hosted database.
For self-service hosting you should bring along enough operations experience that a Linux system doesn't scare you away.

=== Neo4j with Docker

image::{img}neo4j-docker-image-now-in-beta-235x300.jpg[float=right]

link:http://docker.com[Docker] is a lightweight virtualization mechanism to run single applications containerized and restricted on your machine.
Docker images are pre-build in layers from configuration of services one of which would be Neo4j.
A docker image can be started immediately after downloading, no time-consuming boot required.

Neo4j and Docker provide an officially supported link:http://hub.docker.com/_/neo4j[Docker image].
Please also see the documentation for the Neo4j link:/developer/integration/docker/docker-23[version 2.3] and the new link:/developer/integration/docker/docker-30[3.x releases].

Other projects around docker are discussed on our link:/developer/integration/docker[Neo4j & Docker integration page].

=== Hosting on AWS / EC2

Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud.
It is designed to make web-scale cloud computing easier for developers.

Starting from version 3.2.0, link:https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B071P26C9D[Neo4j can be installed from the AWS marketplace^].

If you're using an earlier version, installing Neo4j on any Debian or Ubuntu system can be accomplished by following the instructions on link:http://debian.neo4j.org[our Debian Repository].

For other Linux distributions, download the link:http://neo4j.com/download/other-releases[Neo4j tarball]; it can be uncompressed and run interactively.
Our operations manual discusses several ways to run link:{opsmanual}/installation/linux/[Neo4j as system service on Linux].

=== Hosting on Microsoft Azure

Microsoft Azure is is a cloud computing service created by Microsoft for building, deploying, and managing applications and services through a global network of Microsoft-managed data centers.
It provides software as a service, platform as a service and infrastructure as a service and supports many different programming languages, tools and frameworks, including both Microsoft-specific and third-party software and systems.

Starting from version 3.2.0, link:https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/neo4j.neo4j-enterprise-edition?tab=PlansAndPrice[Neo4j can be installed from the Azure marketplace^].
You can read more in the link:https://neo4j.com/blog/neo4j-microsoft-azure-marketplace-part-1/[release blog post^] or link:https://neo4j.com/blog/deploy-neo4j-microsoft-azure-part-2/[follow the step by step installation guide^].

=== Orchestration

Orchestration systems are systems for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
You can follow the guides below to run Neo4j on some popular orchestration systems.

==== Mesosphere DC/OS

link:https://docs.mesosphere.com/[Mesosphere DC/OS^] is built around the long established link:http://mesos.apache.org/[Apache Mesos^] project.
Mesos is used by companies such as Twitter, Apple, Netflix, or Airbnb to manage their production clusters.

Neo4j is link:https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-dcos[available as a Universe application^] and can be installed via the link:https://mesosphere.github.io/marathon/[Marathon container orchestration platform^].

You can read more in the https://neo4j.com/blog/neo4j-mesosphere-dc-os/[release blog post^] or watch the presentation that Johannes Unterstein gave at the link:/developer/online-meetup/[Neo4j online meetup^].

==== Kubernetes

Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications that builds on 15 years of experience of running production workloads at Google.

Neo4j core servers can be installed using the StatefulSet abstraction, which was introduced as a beta feature in v1.5.0.
Read replicas can be installed using the replication controller abstraction.

Mark Needham's https://github.com/mneedham/neo4j-kubernetes[neo4j-kubernetes^] repository has full instructions to get a cluster up and running.
You can also watch Dippy Aggarwal's talk from GraphConnect San Francisco 2016.
